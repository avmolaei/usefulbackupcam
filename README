useful backup camera system for my car

I'm just so sick of theses useless backup cameras on cars. I mean, yeah, sure, seeing behind you is nice when manoevering, but, really? Beeps when I get closer? Green/orange/red indicators? FFS, I'm not a 6 year old, plus whenever it tells you essentially to stop moving, it turns out there is actually lots of space! I decided to make a useful backup system. Why not, and hear me out: WHY NOT DISPLAYING THE DISTANCE EXPLICITLY WOW OMG (i know teslas do it).

This is how it's going to be: a Raspberry pi (old one bought from friend) handles a camera and the Screen. An arduino handles the lcd display and the ultrasonic sensor. Just an introduction to the Raspberry Pi for me. Easy programming and setup you might say, but the hardest part will be...

Integration! I want this to feel as a stock thing on my 2011 KIA Picanto.

ATM, this repo is empty. I have exams/summer job, not much time.
